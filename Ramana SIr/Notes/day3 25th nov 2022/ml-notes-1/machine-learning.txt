Machine learning 

Main practcal applications
prediction
classification


Data
Machine Learning Techniques
Supervised Learning
Dataset-Training dataset
data-labels
wav1- a
wav2- b
Testing dataset 
wav1 - a
correlation
positive correlation, negative correlation

Eg: Gender prediction on the basis of names
swapnil -Male
sayuja -Female
ketan-male
jerin-male
sruthi-Female

endswith vowel- Female
endswith consonants-Male

dhiraj-Male

Supervised-classification and regression
classification- labels
regression- The machine should give a continous value
size-small, medium, large
toppings- chicken, veg, pork
price-300, 200, 400
y=mx+c

Unsupervised
Clustering, Association
clustering - Training dataset is given
Eg: rectangles, circles
Association
Training dataset

Reinforcement learning
Rewards for the movement of an agent. 

Corona Prediction
output-Yes/No

Tempearture
