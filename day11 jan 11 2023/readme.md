# convolution are for the seperation of data in images

1. Yolo you only look once

2. FAST R CNN: Region convolution neural network ( deep convolutional network used for object detection)

3. SSD Single shot detector built on top of yolo

4. LSTM : LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY Better version of rnn

5. AttributeError: partially initialized module 'numpy' has no attribute 'array' (most likely due to a circular import)
